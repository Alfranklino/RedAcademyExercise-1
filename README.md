# RedAcademyExercise-1
Here is the first exercise i did for red Academy. It's a test landing page for Red Aacdemy. The topic was to integrate the .jpg given into html5 tags and all this formatted with css and it's brand new capabilities, such as flex-boxes. I've performed some transitions on the form which is before the footer and the result seems pretty modern.
I,ve also created a github account and configured my VsCode in order to manage differents versions of that project. Enjoy :).
